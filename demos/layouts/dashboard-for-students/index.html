This means that variables local to the mixin cannot be used within the passed style block and variables will resolve to the global value:$color: white; @mixin colors($color: blue) { background-color: $color; @content; border-color: $color; } .colors { @include colors { color: $color; } } Compiles to:.colors { background-color: blue; color: white; border-color: blue; } Additionally, this makes it clear that the variables and mixins that are used within the passed block are related to the other styles around where the block is defined. For example:#sidebar { $sidebar-width: 300px; width: $sidebar-width; @include smartphone { width: $sidebar-width / 3; } } Function DirectivesIt is possible to define your own functions in sass and use them in any value or script context. For example:$grid-width: 40px; $gutter-width: 10px;@function grid-width($n) { @return $n * $grid-width + ($n - 1) * $gutter-width; }#sidebar { width: grid-width(5); } Becomes:#sidebar { width: 240px; } As you can see functions can access any globally defined variables as well as accept arguments just like a mixin. A function may have several statements contained within it, and you must call @return to set the return value of the function.As with mixins, you can call Sass-defined functions using keyword arguments. In the above example we could have called the function like this:#sidebar { width: grid-width($n: 5); } It is recommended that you prefix your functions to avoid naming conflicts and so that readers of your stylesheets know they are not part of Sass or CSS. For example, if you work for ACME Corp, you might have named the function above -acme-grid-width.User-defined functions also support variable arguments in the same way as mixins.For historical reasons, function names (and all other Sass identifiers) can use hyphens and underscores interchangeably. For example, if you define a function called grid-width, you can use it as grid_width, and vice versa.Output StyleAlthough the default CSS style that Sass outputs is very nice and reflects the structure of the document, tastes and needs vary and so Sass supports several other styles.Sass allows you to choose between four different output styles by setting the :style option or using the --style command-line flag.:nestedNested style is the default Sass style, because it reflects the structure of the CSS styles and the HTML document they’re styling. Each property has its own line, but the indentation isn’t constant. Each rule is indented based on how deeply it’s nested. For example:Generates:* html #logo { background-image: url(/logo.gif); } The same mixins can be done in the .sass shorthand syntax:=apply-to-ie6-only * html @content+apply-to-ie6-only #logo background-image: url(/logo.gif) Note: when the @content directive is specified more than once or in a loop, the style block will be duplicated with each invocation.Variable Scope and Content BlocksThe block of content passed to a mixin are evaluated in the scope where the block is defined, not in the scope of the mixin.

This means that variables local to the mixin cannot be used within the passed style block and variables will resolve to the global value:$color: white; @mixin colors($color: blue) { background-color: $color; @content; border-color: $color; } .colors { @include colors { color: $color; } } Compiles to:.colors { background-color: blue; color: white; border-color: blue; } Additionally, this makes it clear that the variables and mixins that are used within the passed block are related to the other styles around where the block is defined. For example:#sidebar { $sidebar-width: 300px; width: $sidebar-width; @include smartphone { width: $sidebar-width / 3; } } Function DirectivesIt is possible to define your own functions in sass and use them in any value or script context. For example:$grid-width: 40px; $gutter-width: 10px;@function grid-width($n) { @return $n * $grid-width + ($n - 1) * $gutter-width; }#sidebar { width: grid-width(5); } Becomes:#sidebar { width: 240px; } As you can see functions can access any globally defined variables as well as accept arguments just like a mixin. A function may have several statements contained within it, and you must call @return to set the return value of the function.As with mixins, you can call Sass-defined functions using keyword arguments. In the above example we could have called the function like this:#sidebar { width: grid-width($n: 5); } It is recommended that you prefix your functions to avoid naming conflicts and so that readers of your stylesheets know they are not part of Sass or CSS. For example, if you work for ACME Corp, you might have named the function above -acme-grid-width.User-defined functions also support variable arguments in the same way as mixins.For historical reasons, function names (and all other Sass identifiers) can use hyphens and underscores interchangeably. For example, if you define a function called grid-width, you can use it as grid_width, and vice versa.Output StyleAlthough the default CSS style that Sass outputs is very nice and reflects the structure of the document, tastes and needs vary and so Sass supports several other styles.Sass allows you to choose between four different output styles by setting the :style option or using the --style command-line flag.:nestedNested style is the default Sass style, because it reflects the structure of the CSS styles and the HTML document they’re styling. Each property has its own line, but the indentation isn’t constant. Each rule is indented based on how deeply it’s nested. For example:</p></div></div></div> </main> <script>CM.browser.msie===!0&&1*CM.browser.version<=9&&$(".layout-sidebar .Background-image").addClass("is-hacked"),$("body").on("click",".Content-slide-button",function(){$(this).closest(".Content-slide").removeClass("is-shown")}),$("body").on("click",function(s){$.contains($(".Content-slide").get(0),s.target)||$(s.target).is(".Content-slide")||$(".Content-slide").removeClass("is-shown")})</script><script src="/assets/pages/demos/layout-of-dashboard-for-students-2928124c46b8dafd5d179223ac7b3674.js"></script></body></html>
